# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Simple tic tac toe game made with C++. It asks for user names, player 1 plays first and has O's. 
Other player has X's and the game stops afters there is a winner. 
This small project is pretty much done, but I would like to add a AI so that one can play against a computer.

Next steps: 
- Add AI
- Maybe make a user interface
- Make it more user friendly
